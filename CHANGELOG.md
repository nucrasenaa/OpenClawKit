# Changelog

## 2026.1.4 - 2026-02-23

### Added

- Cross-platform credential storage primitives with `CredentialStore`, including
  `KeychainCredentialStore` on Apple platforms and `FileCredentialStore`
  fallback behavior for non-Keychain environments.
- Streaming runtime execution surface (`EmbeddedAgentRuntime.runStream`) and
  channel streaming integration path for progressive output handling.
- Typing heartbeat lifecycle support in auto-reply orchestration for Discord and
  Telegram long-running reply flows.
- Security audit primitives (`SecurityAuditRunner`, `SecurityAuditReport`) for
  risky defaults, plaintext-secret detection, and filesystem permission checks.
- Per-channel outbound throttling (`ChannelSendThrottlePolicy`) and per-provider
  throttling (`ModelProviderThrottlePolicy`) with delay/drop strategies.

### Changed

- iOS example deploy settings now persist secrets in secure storage with one-time
  legacy plaintext migration and scrubbed JSON persistence.
- iOS example skills are project-owned and sourced from
  `Examples/iOS/OpenClawiOS/skills` instead of repo-root `skills/`.
- Auto-reply runtime flow now supports optional stream-driven response assembly
  and emits stream-chunk diagnostics when enabled.
- `OpenClawSDK` now exposes `runSecurityAudit(...)` and can publish audit
  findings into `RuntimeDiagnosticsPipeline`.

### Tests

- Added credential migration and secure-store selection coverage for keychain +
  fallback semantics.
- Added iOS project-skills discovery regression coverage in `SkillRegistryTests`.
- Added runtime streaming and auto-reply stream-path tests, including chunk/final
  marker assertions.
- Added typing heartbeat cadence/stop-condition tests for both Discord and
  Telegram channels.
- Added security audit coverage for severity classification, hardened-config
  baselines, and diagnostics publication.
- Added channel/model throttling regression coverage for burst delay, drop
  behavior, retry diagnostics, and provider fallback behavior.

## 2026.1.3 - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Model runtime parity contracts for streaming generation, cancellation-aware policies,
  fallback provider chains, and local runtime hints.
- Local model runtime integration upgrades: runtime switching, model lifecycle control,
  state save/restore hooks, token streaming, and cancellation token propagation.
- Skills parity expansion with pluggable executor backends, explicit-only invocation
  policy controls, per-skill/default timeout enforcement, and richer invocation metadata.
- Channel/runtime reliability primitives including health snapshots, retry/backoff
  policy controls, built-in command handling (`/health`, `/status`, `/help`), and
  stronger outbound delivery status tracking.
- Centralized diagnostics and usage pipeline (`RuntimeDiagnosticsPipeline`) with
  app-queryable snapshots for runs, model calls, skill usage, and channel delivery.
- iOS example app expansion into a multi-tab runtime console for Deploy, Chat, Models,
  Skills, Channels, and Diagnostics workflows.

### Changed

- Runtime diagnostics types are now shared in `OpenClawCore` and emitted from both
  `EmbeddedAgentRuntime` and channel auto-reply flows with stable metadata fields.
- `OpenClawSDK` now supports diagnostics pipeline injection for web-channel monitoring
  and one-shot reply flows.
- Gateway reconnect cancellation handling is hardened to avoid lingering reconnect
  loops after disconnect/teardown.

### Tests

- Added dedicated diagnostics pipeline tests for aggregate metrics, sink wiring,
  and SDK-level integration.
- Added channel auto-reply regression coverage for outbound failure diagnostics and
  retry-attempt metadata assertions.
- Added runtime timeout diagnostics regression coverage and gateway reconnect-stop
  E2E assertions after explicit disconnect.

## 2026.1.2.1 - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- GitHub Actions Swift validation now consistently provisions the Swift 6.2.0
  toolchain required by the package tools version.
- CI Swift setup is hardened against transient upstream signing-key fetch issues
  by using resilient setup options in workflow configuration.
- Linux compatibility is restored for HTTP model/channel providers by adding the
  required conditional `FoundationNetworking` imports.
- Linux test builds are fixed by adding conditional `FoundationNetworking`
  imports in networking-heavy test suites that mock `URLRequest`.
- Cross-platform socket probing in `PortUtils` now uses Linux-safe socket-type
  casting for Swift 6.2 compatibility.

## 2026.1.2.2 - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- Skill invocation now runs in the SDK runtime layer via
  `SkillInvocationEngine`, instead of app-specific skill interfacing in the
  iOS example.
- Skill invocation matching is now generic for arbitrary workspace skills by
  explicit command (`/skill <name>` and `/<name>`) and natural-language skill
  name references.
- iOS example deployment now syncs project `skills/` into the app sandbox
  workspace so runtime skill discovery works consistently at deploy time.
- Weather sample skill now uses a JavaScript entrypoint
  (`skills/weather/scripts/weather.js`) so invocation behavior stays in-skill
  and iOS-compatible.
- Removed hardcoded sensitive defaults from iOS deploy settings
  (`OpenClawAppState`) for Discord and model-provider credentials.

### Tests

- Added auto-reply coverage for generic arbitrary skill invocation by skill-name
  references.
- Added/updated weather skill invocation coverage through SDK skill execution
  flow in channel auto-reply tests.

## 2026.1.2 - 2026-02-17

### Added

  `release.yml` workflows for build/test/security/release automation.
- Telegram channel adapter with polling lifecycle, mention gating, typing signal,
  outbound delivery, and deterministic transport-mocked tests.
- WhatsApp Cloud API adapter with send endpoint integration, webhook verification
  + event ingestion support, and deterministic transport-mocked tests.
- Model-provider expansion with OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and Gemini
  providers plus expanded provider configuration blocks.
- iOS deploy-time provider/model selection and persisted credentials for OpenAI,
  OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Gemini, and Foundation provider modes.

- Structured channel diagnostics events for ingress/routing/model-call/egress
  phases to improve runtime observability.

### Changed

  model, and agent sections for backward-compatible config evolution.
- Session resolution now updates stored agent binding when route mapping changes,
  enabling lightweight per-route agent assignment.
- Conversation memory prompt formatting now uses explicit trust boundaries and
  escapes unsafe markup tokens before injection into model prompts.

  metadata fallback provider behavior.
- Added iOS build-gate-compatible tests for multi-agent route mapping and
  auto-reply mapped-agent session binding.

  formatting.

## 2026.1.1.1 - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- Discord deploy lifecycle now starts a gateway presence client so deployed bots
  report online status and shut down presence cleanly when deployment stops.
- Discord message handling now uses mention-only trigger policy with startup
  backlog cursor initialization to prevent replay spam on deploy.
- Discord mention triggers now acknowledge with an 👀 reaction before reply
  processing begins.
- Adapter conversation turns are now persisted in a file-backed conversation
  memory store and reinjected into subsequent prompts for session-aware context.

### Tests

- Expanded Discord adapter coverage for presence lifecycle startup/teardown,
  backlog skip behavior, mention-only filtering, and reaction acknowledgement.
- Added conversation memory store persistence/context formatting tests and
  auto-reply integration tests for prompt context injection.

## 2026.1.1 - 2026-02-15

### Added

  frontmatter parsing, precedence-aware merging, and runtime prompt injection.
- JavaScriptCore skill execution sandbox with strict workspace path jail and
  guarded filesystem host APIs for code-executing skills on Apple platforms.
- Bootstrap/personality prompt context loading (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`,
  `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`,

  transcript persistence, periodic memory summarization jobs, and runtime
  deployment wiring for local + Discord chat flows.

### Changed

- iOS example project now links the local `OpenClawKit` package product and
  enforces warnings-as-errors from project build settings.
- iOS compatibility hardened in core utilities (home-directory resolution and
  process execution fallback behavior).
- iOS validation scripts now rely on target build settings for warnings-as-
  errors to avoid transitive package flag conflicts.

### Documentation

- Added inline `///` API documentation for major public surfaces in
  `OpenClawKit`, `OpenClawAgents`, `OpenClawChannels`, and `OpenClawCore`
  configuration models.
